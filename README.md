# react-datetime-range-super-picker

###### React date, time, date-time range, calender, clock and even month i.e. all in one picker !!

###### This is a _super_ picker due to how it handles date-time props for each components. This component permenantly solves the time handling issue where you get certain format of Date as an input and you have to return completely different format after user edit. Not to forget it does it while looking extremely cool !
